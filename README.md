SocialCoin
==========

SocialCoin (SOC) - The first crypto coin that gives a lot back to society!
SocialCoin's vision is to be the #1 crypto-currency to be accepted by charities and research facilities.

SocialCoin is a new generation of scrypt coin that is descendant of Litecoin. Like Litecoin it uses scrypt as a proof of work scheme.

SocialCoin starts with 10,000 coins per block and the block value is reduced by a factor of 2 every 50,000 blocks.

Other Specifications: - 120 seconds block target - Difference retargets every ~2.5 blocks - Total coins will be 900 million coins.

Charities and research facilities will be chosen by the community on a monthly basis, receiving a chunk of the charity fund.
The charity fund starts with 5% of the total coins value and is open for extra donations from anyone in the community.

Ports: 8915 for wallet and mining, 8946 for RPC
